# GDALPolygonize

I needed an utility to use GDALPolygonize in R. As far as I know it is not implemented in R yet. At least it is does not come with the rgdal package. Therefore, here is an implementation of the C API GDALPolygonize tool. It does not keep any of the creations options passed to the rutine with papszOptions, and it is always using 8 point connectedness. I did not need to change anything.
