# GDALPolygonize

I need an utility to use GDALPolygonize in R. As far as I know it is not implemented in R. At least it does not come with the [rgdal package](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rgdal/).

Therefore, I made a simple implementation of the C API GDALPolygonize tool. It has limitations:

* It does not keep any of the creations options (I omitted the papszOptions argument).
* It does not overwrite an existing file.
* The output is always in "ESRI Shapefile" file format.
